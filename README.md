# Crime-Prediction
Crime Prediction Project
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict crime types and recommend appropriate police deployment based on the given time, location, and other contextual data.

Features
Predicts the type of crime based on date, time, and location inputs.
Recommends the most suitable police deployment for the predicted crime.
Uses Decision Trees, Random Forests, and other ML models.
Simple interface using Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and testing.
Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to run this project locally:

Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/nishant1194/crime_Prediction.git
cd crime_Prediction
Step 2: Step 2: Install Python
Check if Python is installed:

python --version
Step 3: Install pip (Python Package Installer)
If pip is not installed, run:

python -m ensurepip --upgrade
Check pip version:

pip --version
Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
Activate the Environment:

On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
On Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
Step 5: Install Dependencies
Install required Python packages:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
###Step 6: Install Jupyter Notebook

pip install notebook
Step 7: Launch Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook
Step 8: Run the Project
Jupyter will open in your browser.
Navigate to the crime_Prediction folder.
There will be a dataset1.csv which we use in this ml project.
Open the notebook ( .ipynb).
